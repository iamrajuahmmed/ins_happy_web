                <p>We are inspired by the Kingdom of Bhutan’s philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH). The Institute of Happiness (IOH) is an evidence-based think and do tank that seeks to be a thought center for Bhutanese GNH experience. The institute will serve as an accumulator for GNH philosophy and present the alternative development paradigm for actors in societal structure for harmony .
                    <br><br>
                 The IOH’s objectives are to:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Conduct and facilitate collaborative research with institutions/ partners</li>
                    <li>Develop, Assess and Impart training/skills for actors in the policy process including leaders from Government, Business and Civil Societies.</li>
                    <li>Organize, coordinate and lead experiential trips to learn, understand and discuss the Bhutanese GNH journey.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h2>Our Story</h2>
                 <p>The GNH philosophy originated in Bhutan, but has inspired scholars, academics, and policymakers around the world. The IOH shall be a private intellectual platform where academics and practitioners of GNH philosophies can convene to discuss, learn, and implement best practices in development, governance, policy, and business management. <br><br>

                    The IOH has three primary practice areas: <a href="traning.php">Training</a>, <a href="research.php">Research</a> and <a href="collaboration.php">Collaboration</a>. <br><br>
